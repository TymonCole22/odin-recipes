# odin-recipes
This is a project that will display recipes. This is intended to show the usage of basic html and git skills.

After showing the usage of basic html and git skills, I later included css to stylize my recipe webpages. I do this by utilizing basic css selectors and a handful of properties.
With these I styled the coloring of the background as well as the text. I also gave the headers and general text different font styles/families.
